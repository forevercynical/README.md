# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Fellow Developer!

## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer, enjoy learning and trying new things during my free time. I really enjoy Python for small tasks and have pretty much grown to love JavaScript because of how versatile it is.

## Highlighted Projects

- [**Pymino**](https://github.com/forevercynical/pymino): A Python wrapper for the Amino Apps API, Pymino simplifies the creation of bots for Amino Apps with its modern and user-friendly library. It's a fully reverse-engineered client, developed primarily for educational purposes. While it enables extensive interaction within the Amino Apps, please be aware that using this client might conflict with Amino Apps' Terms of Service. Usage should be responsible and at your own risk.

## Currently Working On

- **Pymino**: I'm actively maintaining Pymino, a Python wrapper for the Amino Apps API. This project involves the development of a modern and user-friendly library for the Amino Apps API, enabling the creation of bots for Amino Apps.
- **React Chat Application**: Developing a chat application that allows users to create group chats and communicate with each other. It's a fun project that I'm working on to learn more about React and web development.
- **React Native Mobile Game**: I'm also working on a mobile game using React Native. It's a fun project that I'm working on to bring a little nostalgia to the mobile gaming scene.
- **Random Projects**: I'll pick up random projects here and there when I'm bored or having writer's block.
