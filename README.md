## About Me

I'm a **self-taught developer** who enjoys learning and trying new things in my free time. I'm particularly fond of **Python** for small tasks and have grown to love **JavaScript** for its versatility.

## Highlighted Projects

It's a fully reverse-engineered client, developed primarily for educational purposes. While it enables extensive interaction within the Amino Apps, please be aware that using this client might conflict with Amino Apps' Terms of Service. Usage should be responsible and at your own risk.

## Currently Working On

- **React Chat Application**: A project focusing on group chats and communication, enhancing my skills in React and web development.
